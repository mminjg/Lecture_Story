## About The Project

2020 2nd semester 'Open Software Platform' final project  
Tools: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Firebase

Students usually use the school community to get information about lectures.  
For example, asking questions about assignments, checking the ranks of their own scores and evaluating lectures.

However, since the existing school community forums are not divided for _each lecture_, it is difficult to find information about the same lectures in the current and past semesters.  
Also, It is also important to know the flow of the past semester because knowing the grade standards, assignment information, or problem solving tips is helpful in learning and when choosing a lecture.

So we focused on making it easy to obtain lecture information(evaluation, score, etc.) with timeline and useful for lecture learning.
